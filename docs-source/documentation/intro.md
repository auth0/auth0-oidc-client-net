# Auth0 OIDC Client

The Auth0 OIDC Client allows you to add authentication for your .NET Client applications. The Auth0 OIDC Client supports the following platforms:

* Universal Windows Platform
* Windows Presentation Foundation (.NET 4.52 and higher)
* Windows Forms (.NET 4.52 and higher)

This library is based on the [IdentityModel OpenID Connect Client Library](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2), and simply acts as a very thin wrapper around this library, ensuring that the correct configuration is passed to Auth0.
