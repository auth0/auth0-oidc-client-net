# Browsers

The SDK is configured to use a platform-specific browser implementation to handle the redirect to Auth0. Depending on the platform, one or more browser implementations might be available.
An example is the `Auth0.OidcClient.iOS` SDK, which auto-selects the browser based on the version of iOS used.

Even though the use-cases are limited, as our SDK is configured to auto-select the browser based on the verion of iOS being used, you could ensure all versions of iOS use the same browser by passing an explicit `Browser` instance to the `Browser` property of the `Auth0ClientOptions`:

```
var client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions {
    Domain = "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID",
    Browser = new SFSafariViewControllerBrowser()
});
```

In case the default implementations that each SDK provides does not suit the needs for your application, each SDK allows you to specify your own custom browser implementation by implementing the `IBrowser` interface.

```
public class CustomBrowser : IBrowser
{
    protected override Task<BrowserResult> Launch(
        BrowserOptions options,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
    )  {
        var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<BrowserResult>();

        // Implement custom browser and navigate to options.StartUrl.
        // Set the BrowserResult with the callbackUrl that Auth0 redirects back to,
        // this URL is the URL that contains state and code query parameters.
        tcs.SetResult(new BrowserResult {
            ResultType = BrowserResultType.Success,
            Response = callbackUrl
        });

        return tcs.Task;
    }
}
```

With the `CustomBrowser` implementation in place, instantiate `Auth0Client` with the appropriate `Auth0ClientOptions`:

```
var client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions {
    Domain = "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID",
    Browser = new CustomBrowser()
});
```

The SDK will automatically call `Browser.Launch()` and use the result that's being set as part of `tcs.SetResult()`.
